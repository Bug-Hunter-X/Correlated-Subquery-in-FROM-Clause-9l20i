The correct way to achieve the desired result is to use a JOIN with a derived table (subquery in the FROM clause) that calculates the average salary for each department.

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, e.salary, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
) AS avg_salaries ON e.department_id = avg_salaries.department_id
WHERE e.salary > avg_salaries.avg_salary;
```

This version correctly uses a derived table in the FROM clause to compute the average salaries and then performs a JOIN to compare employee salaries against the averages.
